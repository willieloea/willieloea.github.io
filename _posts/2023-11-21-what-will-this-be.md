Hello, welcome to my blog.

Occasionally I have the urge to share an idea, or to force myself to articulate
an idea clearly by writing it. I have hence decided to experiment with starting
a blog. I will share thoughts, questions, art, technical work, and
achievements/reflections from time to time.

Here is some information about me:  
Name: Willie Loftie-Eaton  
DOB: 2001/06/20  
I grew up in Windhoek Namibia. Went to school an Curro Windhoek Gymnasium
Private School and Matriculated in 2020. Currently studying Computer Science at
the University of Stellenbosch (since 2021).

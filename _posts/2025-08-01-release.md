hello

can you feel it. humanity's tether to reality slipping. your part in it?

do you notice how things aren't real anymore?

are you really doing your job, or simply doing what appears to work?

how close are you to the machine? are you the reason we're on the path to a day where [the machine stops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Machine_Stops)?

how do we win? how do we know what is real in a word where every surface is being engulfed, engulfed in release?

release of care, release of control, release of effort, release of attention?

take care, take control, make effort, give your full attention.

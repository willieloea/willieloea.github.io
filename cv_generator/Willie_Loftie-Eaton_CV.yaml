    about:
      - Computer Science graduate from Stellenbosch Univeristy. In my undergraduate
        studies, I gained experience with a variety of programming languages (Java, C,
        Python, HTML & CSS, React.js and some x86 assembly). In my honours year, I'm
        focusing more on data science, studying machine learning and computational
        intelligence (particle swarm optimization and evolutionary computation).
        I'm eager to work hard and solve problems.

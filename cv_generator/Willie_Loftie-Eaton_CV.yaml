    about:
      - Computer Science graduate from Stellenbosch Univeristy. In my undergraduate
        studies, I gained experience with a variety of programming languages (Java, C,
        Python, SQL, HTML & CSS, React.js and some x86 assembly). This year, I'm
        doing my honours in computer science, focusing more on data science, studying
        machine learning and computational intelligence (particle swarm optimization
        and evolutionary computation). I want to have a productive career, and I'm
        eager to work hard and learn a lot in 2026.

            <h3>What are Cellular Automata?</h3>
						<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
							Unfortunately I realised while writing this that it is not easy to expain cellular automata (CA) without images or drawings, and I
							do not want to add too many of those to this blog, so I will do a rough job of explaining what they are, but there may be gaps.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
							I like wikipedia's description of what a cellular automata (ca) may be, and so the followng paragraph is largely copied from there:
						</p>
						<p class="blog-quote">
							A <span class="blog-highlight">cellular automaton</span> consists of a regular <span class="blog-highlight">grid</span> of 
							<span class="blog-highlight">cells</span>, each in one of a finite number of <span class="blog-highlight">states</span>, 
							such as on and off. The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions. For each cell, a set of cells called 
							its <span class="blog-highlight">neighborhood</span> is defined relative to the specified cell. An initial state (time t = 0)
							is selected by assigning a state for each cell. A new generation is created (advancing t by 1), according to some fixed 
							<span class="blog-highlight">rule</span> that determines the new state of each cell in terms of the current state of the cell
							and the states of the cells in its neighborhood. Typically, the rule for updating the state of cells is the same for each cell 
							and does not change over time, and is applied to the whole grid simultaneously, though there are exceptions.
						</p>
            <br>
						<h3>Life and Cellular Automata</h3>
						<p>
							In any given CA, patterns of states in its grid may emerge that have <span class="blog-highlight">robustness</span> - the ability
							to continue the pattern, when other patterns of states interacts with them. To use an analogy, the human skin is more robust than
							a piece of cloth since if both were scratched until a small tear apeared, the skin would heal (re-create the pattern that was 
							there) while the cloth would not.
						</p>
						<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
							new par
						</p>
						What do I want to say?
						I want to say that with rules, patterns of states emerge. The patterns that are most robust will evolve.
						Patterns make us, we want to make patterns.

						Life as a CA glider and why programming changes matter:
							I think of life as emergent patterns of self-replicating or -regulating states
						of matter in reality, where matter is the smallest element in reality which can
						have a state. An example that seems to make this definition clear for me and 
						many othes would be the life in the reality of Conway's game of life (gol).
							In gol, life emerges in the form of still lifes, oscilators, and spaceships 
						[1]. These patterns can vary greatly in complexity and robustness (the ability
						to withstand interaction [2] with other patterns of life in reality). As I said 
						earlier it is clear to many that some of the patterns of states in gol seem to
						exhibit properties of self-replication or self-regulation and look like they
						exhibit life, hence the name: Game of Life.
							The same is true in our reality. Certain patterns of states in reality occur
						in clumps of reality. Patterns that self-replicate are more likely to exist for
						longer, and so too with patterns that are good at self-regulation i.e. 
						robustness. Evolution by natural selection is the process of patterns 
						interacting with each other and one of the following happens: all interacting
						patterns cease to replicate; some patterns continue to replicate while others
						don't; a new living pattern emerges.
							Given enough time and space, highly robust patterns might emerge, and they
						may consist of (or be a part of) living patterns that form a hyper-pattern. This
						is what we are: a massive number and complicated series of patterns that emerged
						to make an extremely robust hyper-pattern, the human.
							I'm a computer scientist who has not studied any of the hard sciences 
						formally, so there will likely be gaps in the following summary, but here are
						a few layers of pattern formation on the path to a human pattern:
							quark, atom, molecule, dna, cell, tissue, organ, organism (human). [3]
						
						I'll continue later.
						
						
						[1] The wikipedia definitions for these patterns are: 
									still lifes, which do not change from one generation to the next; 
									oscillators, which return to their initial state after a finite number of 
										generations; and 
									spaceships, which translate themselves across the grid
						[2] Patterns interact when the cells that form them change their state in the
									next time step, based on the state of cell(s) in the other pattern.
						[3] This is a bit of a digression but an interesting thing to note is that these
									patterns did not emerge/arrive in this order. The organism that later 
									became a human came before certain tissues or organs that are now part
									of the human pattern.

            <h3>What is the meaning of life?</h3>
            <p>
							For me, my purpose is to create the maximally robust and happy pattern.

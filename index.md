<h1>Hi, I'm Willie Loftie-Eaton</h1>

## About Me
I am a BSc Hons Computer Science student at the University of Stellenbosch. I
enjoy studying Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics. In my free time I
practice guitar, read, play ultimate frisbee, and run. I would like to have an
impactful career and hence I try to organize my life such that I gather useful
skills, and learn about cool problems to tackle. I'm interested in making
civilization last as long as possible. I'm always looking for friends, so feel
free to reach out if you want to chat.

To know more about me, you can visit my [blog](./blog) where I will share things that interest me.  

My resume lives [here](/assets/cv/wle_cv.pdf) as a PDF.

## My Work
[`cilpy`](https://github.com/willieloftieeaton/cilpy)  
A computational intelligence library for Python. This library allows researchers
to study nature inspired algorithms on dynamic, constrained, and multi-objective
optimization problems.

[CAlab](https://github.com/willieloftieeaton/CAlab)  
The goal of this project is to enable computations and visualizations of
Cellular Automata. It is something I work on in my free time, and at the moment
is capable of computing 1-dimensional Cellular Automata.

[This website](https://github.com/willieloftieeaton/willieloftieeaton.github.io)  
This website serves to inform you about me, and is a place where I can share my ideas and work with the world.

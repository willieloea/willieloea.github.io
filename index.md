<h1>Hi, I'm Willie Loftie-Eaton</h1>

## About Me
I am a recent BSc Hons Computer Science graduate from the University of
Stellenbosch. I enjoy studying Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics. In
my free time I practice guitar, read, play ultimate frisbee, and run. I would
like to have an impactful career and hence I try to organize my life such that I
gather useful skills, and learn about cool problems to tackle. I'm interested in
making civilization last as long as possible. I'm always looking for friends, so
feel free to reach out if you want to chat.

To know more about me, you can visit my [blog](./blog) where I will share things
that interest me.  

My resume lives [here](/assets/cv/wle_cv.pdf) as a PDF.

## My Work
[`cilpy`](https://github.com/willieloea/cilpy)  
A computational intelligence library for Python. This library allows researchers
to study nature inspired algorithms on dynamic, constrained, and multi-objective
optimization problems.

[SU Developer Society](https://legacy.su.devsoc.co.za/)
I am a co-founder of the SU Developer Society (SUDS), and organized events for
the society in the second semester of 2025. The goals of the society are to
build friendships, projects, and industry relationships, while helping students
explore the vast landscape of computer science. I am no longer part of the
leadership team of the society.

[CAlab](https://github.com/willieloea/CAlab)  
The goal of this project is to enable computations and visualizations of
Cellular Automata. It is something I work on in my free time, and at the moment
is capable of computing 1-dimensional Cellular Automata.

[This website](https://github.com/willieloea/willieoea.github.io)  
This website serves to inform you about me, and is a place where I can share my
ideas and work with the world.
